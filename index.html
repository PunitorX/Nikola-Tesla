                                <p>
                                Tesla was born in the small town Smilijan, in the then existing Autrian Empire, now Croatia, on July 10th 1856. He was the 4th child out of 5, having 3 sisters and 1 brother. His brother died when Nikola was 5 in a horse accident. He began primary school in 1861 studying German, arithmetic, and religion. He began attending high school in 1870 at Higher Real Gymnasium, finishing a normal 4 year term in 3 years. It was during these years that Tesla became interested in electricity and physics.
                                </p>
                                <p>After graduating highschool, Tesla nearly died after contracting cholera, becoming bedridden for 9 months. It was during this time his father promised to send him to school, instead of becoming a priest.</p>
                                <p>
                                In 1875, he attended Imperial-Royal Technical College in Graz, using a Military Frontier scholarship. By 1878, he left Graz, never graduating, and dissapeared to the town Maribor in Slovenia. Upon being discovered by his father, he was convinced to return home, only for his father to die a month later in April, 1879.

                                <p>In 1882, upon recommendation by Tivadar Puskas, Edison obtained a job with the Continental Edison Company in Paris, France. Due to exceptional knowledge with both physics and engineering, he was soon designing and building dynamos and motors.</p>
                                <p>Soon enough, Edison moved to New York with his manager Charles Batchelor, in 1884. He worked at the "Machine Works" in the lower east side of Manhatten.  Tesla only met Edison a handful of times, one time being after he had stayed up all night
                                     repairing dynamos on the 'SS Oregon'. Upon learning of this, Edison told Batchelor "this is a damned good man."
                                </p>
                                <p>After working at Machine Works for 6 months, Tesla quit. It is not fully understood why he quit, but speculation is directed towards multiple bonuses he was set to recieve and never did. One in particular being worth $50,000 (1.4 million today) after designing twenty-four different types of "standard machines."</p>

                      <p>Though widely disputed on whether or not he created the radio due a patent being created in Britian before him... Tesla created his radio and demonstrated it in 1898. His creation was correlated with a remote controlled boat that allowed a secure form of communication over 50 miles. The unfortunate inability to aquire a patent on time was due to an unforseen fire that detroyed his lab in 1895. He originally named the creation the "Telautomaton" and tried selling it to the US military.</p>
